------------------------
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
------------------------

The top level HTML can be found and edited here:

	src/main/resources/index.html

When published it will be placed here:

	docs/index.html

This html only job is to run a java script file located here:

	docs/confexplorer.js
	
This file is a generated file from the sources located in:

	src/main/kotlin

The top level in this directory is:
	
	Main.kt

This in turn starts up the top level:

	components/App.kt

It does this by because in index.html there is a div id called "root". In Main.kt it grabs this element
and then "renders" it with the "child" described in App::class.

-----
SETUP
-----

One time setup at the top level:

	gradle wrapper

-------
RUNNING
-------

The following will show a browser window:

	./gradlew run

This will cause it to immediately update as soon as any changes are done:

	./gradlew run --continuous


-------
SOURCES
-------

Within App.kt yuou will see an "init()" function and a "render()" function.

Within the render() function you will see a mix of regular kotlin code and specialized
HTML generating code such as "h1".

To adjust the styling of elements there is a "css" function. See VideoPlayer.kt for an example.


---------
DEPLOYING
---------

./gradlew build

git add -A
git commit -m 'some changes'
git push heroku master
